I had a notion to put together a lightning talk based on a thread in the socialz from a long while back.
The talk never formed and the thread is on a site that I don't care to link to anymore, so I'm dropping it here.
The thread started with a bullfrog and it ended in Star Wars.

To which a colleague Jeffrey Horn remarked, "You're pretty good at mixing metaphors.
You must be a programmer."

After a bit, I replied ...

> Jeffrey, I've been trying and failing to think of a metaphor in response.
> Thus, my Developer facade crumbles and my Ops dark side is revealed.
>
> Hmm. Ops Dark Side. There might be something to that.

To wit:

> Our power comes from anger. #DarkSideOps
>
> #JediDevs all want to make their own tools. "I want my lightsaber to be purple!"
> Ops: "Sabers are red."
>
> Red lightsabers are easier to deploy. See, I made this one double-bladed! #DarkSideOps
> ![From the movie Star Wars: the Phantom Menace, a humanoid clad in black draws a lightsaber that has two blades.](/images/darth-maul-two-blades-wat.gif)

(I don't care what your opinion is of the rest of _Star Wars: the Phantom Menance_, that double-bladed lightsaber was heckin' mind-blowing for a Gen-X sci-fi goober to see for the first time in theaters in 1999.)

> #JediDevs have a whole academy.
> [Code schools, yea?]
> #DarkSideOps is generally underfunded with only a master and an apprentice.

(Eric Carlisle gets it: "The rule of two!")

> Kids generally want to grow up to be #JediDevs.
> People just find themselves in #DarkSideOps after some terrible experiences.

A follow-up to Jeffrey:

> OK. Maybe I found a metaphor after all. There must still be good in me.

To which Jeffrey followed up, "Metaphors lead to hate."

Oh! Zing!
