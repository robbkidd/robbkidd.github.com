I [spoke](http://chefconf2014.busyconf.com/schedule#activity_52ddec32fc59cd00880000c4)
at [ChefConf 2014](http://chefconf.opscode.com/chefconf/) this week. A
few folks who used their Google Fu on me said, "That's not your blog, is
it? Nothing has been posted in forever!"

I come from a long-ish career in the security and defense industry
where we are notorious for *not* talking about how we do things. It is
taking time and effort to break habits of holding all cards close to the
chest.

So, yes. This is my blog. Yes, it is stale. I seem to only write when I've
spoken somewhereâ€”which isn't that often. I'm working on doing more of
both of these things.
